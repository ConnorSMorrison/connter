## Connter

Simple social media created with Flask. I followed along with a tutorial from freecodecamp and then added my own stuff to it.

### Why?

My parents don't want me to use social media, so I made my own. There's really no reason.

### How to use

There's no sign in, just go to the website. It might work on mobile, but I dunno. To make a new post, just enter your name and what you want to post. It will refresh and automatically update. Using a wonderful package called [better_profanity](https://pypi.org/project/better-profanity/), all profanity is blocked.
